"""Consolidated startup + shutdown lifecycle for the OpenRAG backend.

`run_startup(app)` and `run_shutdown(app)` collapse what previously lived
as three @app.on_event("startup") handlers and three @app.on_event("shutdown")
handlers into one helper each. The factory registers these as on_event
handlers so they fire under both Starlette's lifespan-from-on_event flow
(production) and `app.router.startup()` / `app.router.shutdown()` (tests).
